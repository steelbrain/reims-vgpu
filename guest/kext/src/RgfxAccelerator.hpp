/*
 * RgfxAccelerator: the reims-graphics device's Metal accelerator for x86-64 macOS
 * guests (docs/graphics-kext/design.md, "Stage 3 guest stack"). It is a SECOND
 * IOService on the same PCI device as the Stage-2 framebuffer (ReimsGraphics):
 * the framebuffer matches in category IOFramebuffer, this matches in category
 * IOAccelerator, and both are children of the one IOPCIDevice (the notes require
 * the accelerator and the framebuffer to share a provider).
 *
 * What it is for: Metal does not scan /Library/GPUBundles. It loads our guest GPU
 * bundle from two properties on THIS service's IOKit personality — MetalPluginName
 * (the bundle path) and MetalPluginClassName (the Obj-C class Metal instantiates as
 * the MTLDevice, RgfxMetalDevice) — which it finds because the service matches
 * IOServiceMatching("IOAccelerator") under IOMatchCategory IOAccelerator. Those two
 * keys live in src/Info.plist's accelerator personality (stage3-apple-metal-iface.md
 * section 1). This service then exposes, over OUR protocol (not Apple's IOGPU
 * user-client ABI), the two things the bundle's transport needs:
 *   - the device BAR-2 region, mapped into the Metal client's task, so the bundle's
 *     RgfxRegion / RgfxRingWriter write into real device memory (clientMemoryForType
 *     on RgfxAcceleratorUserClient), and
 *   - the doorbell: a write of a ring id to RGFX_REG_DOORBELL in BAR 0, to wake the
 *     host's consumer of a queue's submission ring (ringDoorbell, reached from the
 *     user client's external method).
 *
 * ========================= BOOT-GATED DECISION (UNKNOWN #1) =========================
 * BASE CLASS / KERNEL FAMILY. stage3-apple-metal-iface.md section 3 and
 * docs/graphics-kext/design.md Decided 15 record that our guest runs the ported
 * IOGPUFamily stack, that IOAcceleratorFamily2 cannot start in a kernel where
 * IOGPUFamily runs, and that our accelerator therefore aligns with IOGPU. The exact
 * IOGPU kernel base class (an IOGPU, itself an IOAccelerator) and its submission /
 * allocation user-client ABI are Apple-private and are NOT in the macOS SDK or the
 * KDK, so they cannot be subclassed off the guest — only a guest boot + IORegistry +
 * user-client trace settles them (notes UNKNOWN #1; design.md Open).
 *
 * This scaffold subclasses the base the SDK DOES expose, IOAccelerator
 * (IOKit/graphics/IOAccelerator.h), which is what Metal's IOServiceMatching(
 * "IOAccelerator") enumeration matches. That is enough to publish the Metal
 * discovery keys and to stand up OUR own region-map + doorbell user client, which is
 * all that compiles offline. On the guest the base very likely becomes the IOGPU
 * family class; the Metal keys, the PCI match, and our user-client protocol below are
 * expected to carry over unchanged. DO NOT fabricate the IOGPU base or its selectors
 * here.
 * ===================================================================================
 *
 * Our own code; it names only SDK-public IOKit classes.
