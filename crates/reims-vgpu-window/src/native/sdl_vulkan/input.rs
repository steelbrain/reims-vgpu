//! A window's input through SDL: its pointer, wheel and key events to the host's callbacks
//! ([`crate::config::WindowCallbacks`]), on the UI thread.
//!
//! [`Input`] belongs to one window. The UI thread reads each SDL event's values and hands them
//! to it with what the window knows ([`At`]: the event's point in the window, the image's
//! rectangle, the guest's mode). It decides with the crate's pure logic ([`crate::keys`],
//! [`crate::capture`], [`crate::geometry`], [`crate::scroll`]) and queues what to send, which
//! [`send`] then hands the host's callbacks, taken from the [`crate::handle::Window`] at each
//! event: after the window's end there are none, and nothing is sent.
//!
//! What the guest gets:
//! - **The pointer** once the guest has a mode, at the guest pixel under the host's pointer, held
//!   at the image's nearest edge outside it; a move is sent where that pixel changes. A click in
//!   the image captures the keyboard and the pointer; the click that focuses the window (one that
//!   comes within [`FOCUS_CLICK_NS`] of the window gaining the keyboard) is not sent. A click
//!   outside the image is not sent and starts nothing. A button's release is sent wherever it
//!   happens, so a drag that leaves the image ends in the guest. The left, middle and right
//!   buttons and the two side buttons each have their bit.
//! - **The wheel** over the image, once the guest has a mode: SDL's whole notches as wheel
//!   notches, or, where the host takes smooth scrolling, each event's distance at
//!   [`crate::scroll::POINTS_PER_LINE`] points a line, with its notches, in no gesture (SDL gives
//!   no phases). The guest gets the device's own direction: SDL's "flipped" (natural scrolling)
//!   deltas are flipped back, so the guest's own setting applies; left is above 0, as the host's
//!   callbacks take it.
//! - **Keys** by position ([`super::keymap`]), one down and one up each: the host's repeats are
//!   dropped, since the guest repeats a held key itself. With no menu of the host's to drive,
//!   every key goes to the guest, captured or not, but what the compositor keeps for itself while
//!   not captured. Ctrl+Alt on Windows, Ctrl+Alt+Super elsewhere, lifts every key held and
//!   releases capture: the chord the title names.
//! - **No stuck keys**: losing the keyboard, releasing capture and closing send an up for every
//!   key held; losing the keyboard and closing lift the buttons held too.
//!
//! While captured, the window grabs the keyboard (`SDL_SetWindowKeyboardGrab`): on Wayland the
//! compositor's shortcuts inhibitor, so its own shortcuts reach the guest; and SDL holds the
//! pointer over the image ([`Input::pointer_confinement`], `crate::sdl::shell`).
